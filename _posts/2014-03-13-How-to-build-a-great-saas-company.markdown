<p>
Entrepreneurship is “the pursuit of opportunity beyond the resources you currently control” - Howard Stevenson,  Professor Emeritus  Harvard University
</p>  	  

<p>
Before you set off to build the best software as a service (SAAS) company on the planet, you need to come to grips with 5 requirements which you cannot  escape. Without a doubt having a very good idea is important, as is finding a product / market fit, and building a brilliant team. These are a given.
</p>  	  

<p>
The 5 below will help you execute on your idea and operate .
</p>  	  

<p>
1. Speed Matters. Everything is live. Everything is important. Everything is a production issue. It’s critical you solve issues, respond to customers, and innovate quickly. Your business depends on it. Your reputation, which is global and transparent, depends on it. Speed matters because others are working on the same problem with more resources than you. And they are younger, smarter, and better looking!
</p>  	  

<p>
2. Automate. See 1. If you don’t automate, you won’t have time to innovate. 
</p>  	  

<p>
3. Monitor. See 2. Automate when you can, but keep your finger on the pulse of the business. You may build a brilliant dashboard, but sometimes it means watching logs on an  instance or seeing the problem first-hand while screen-sharing with a customer.
</p>  	  

<p>
4. Build Systems. Everywhere. Then Monitor and Automate.
</p>  	  

<p>
If you fail to fully grasp the importance of this requirement, and you have a business model allowing efficient customer acquisition, you will die a painful death at the hands of too many processes for you and your staff to manage.
</p>  	  

<p>
5. Communicate. Your organization (top to bottom) has to be on the same page. Most companies today are distributed. We aren’t sitting in the same room nor are we necessarily in the same time. We wrestle with this  every day. No process or software on it own will solve it.
</p>  	  

<p>
Practice sharing important stuff every day - not just with your team but with customers. Eliminate back channels and be more transparent than you are comfortable with.
